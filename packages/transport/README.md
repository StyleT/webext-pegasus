[![Package version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/@webext-pegasus%2Ftransport)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webext-pegasus/transport)

Turns surface specific browser APIs into unified transport layer.

## Supports

* **Runtime contexts:** window (injected script), popup, devtools, content script, background, options, sidepanel (_planned_)
* **Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge + others supported by [webextension-polyfill](https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill)


## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
npm install -S @webext-pegasus/transport
```

Initialize Pegasus transport layer **once** for every runtime context you use in your extension.

`background.ts`

```typescript
import { initPegasusTransport } from '@webext-pegasus/transport/background';

initPegasusTransport();
// You can use all other Pegasus packages after it
```

As soon as Pegasus Transport was initialized - all other code that relies on transport layer may simply do the following:

```typescript
import {getTransportAPI} from '@webext-pegasus/transport';

// This will work in any runtime context as initPegasusTransport() set needed adapter within module lexical scope
const {sendMessage} = getTransportAPI();
sendMessage(/* ... */);
```

## Available entrypoints:
 - `@webext-pegasus/transport/background`
 - `@webext-pegasus/transport/content-script`
 - `@webext-pegasus/transport/devtools`
 - `@webext-pegasus/transport/options`
 - `@webext-pegasus/transport/popup`
 - `@webext-pegasus/transport/window` (for injected scripts)


## Security risks while communicating with injected script

The following note only applies if and only if, you will be sending/receiving messages to/from `window` contexts. There's no security concern if you will be only working with `content-script`, `background`, `popup`, `options`, or `devtools` scope, which is the default setting.

`window` context(s) in tab `A` get unlocked the moment you call `initPegasusTransport({allowWindowMessagingForNamespace: 'TEST'})` in your extension's content script AND `initPegasusTransport({namespace: 'TEST'})` in your injected script.

Unlike `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `chrome.runtime.connect`, which requires extension's manifest to specify sites allowed to talk with the extension, this package has no such measure by design, which means any webpage whether you intended or not, can do `sendMessage(msgId, data, 'background')` or something similar that produces same effect, as long as it uses same protocol used by this library and namespace set to same as yours.

So to be safe, if you will be interacting with `window` contexts, treat incoming data as you would treat user input.

As an example if you plan on having something critical, **always** verify the `sender` before responding:

```javascript
// background.js

import { onMessage } from '@webext-pegasus/transport/background';

onMessage("getUserBrowsingHistory", (message) => {
  const { data, sender } = message;
  // Respond only if request is from 'devtools', 'content-script', 'popup', 'options', or 'background' endpoint
});
```

## Credits

This library is based on the [Server Side Up's](https://github.com/serversideup) implementation of the [webext-bridge](https://github.com/serversideup/webext-bridge) in context of RPC stack. However it simplifies use of the `sendMessage`/`onMessage` APIs in conponents that may be present within different runtime contexts.
